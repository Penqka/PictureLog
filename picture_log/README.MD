**###### PICTURE LOG ######**

Program that takes a picture saves it locally and sends it to your email address.
It works in the background and is run whenever you set it up.

Follow the documentation to enable gmail to work with Yagmail.

Or just allow two-factor authentication in gmail. After that generate a password from the button bellow the two-factor authentication.

Use Windows Task Scheduler to set up when the program is executed.
Every time the computer wakes up, or turns on or whatever you like.
Follow the instructions from the link.

I suggest you create a separate gmail account to work only with this program.
